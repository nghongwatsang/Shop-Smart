To run the ShopSmart application, follow these steps:

1. Have docker installed and running
2. Have docker compose installed
3. In root directory run:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This may take a couple of minutes to complete and it will be finished loading when you see in docker that the frontend and backend containers are running.

When Docker is finished loading, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000
