# Raw Scraper Output

This directory contains raw JSON files from individual store scrapers.

Each scraper writes its output here in the format: `{store_name}_products.json`

Example files:

- `aldi_products.json`
- `hannaford_products.json`
- `target_products.json`

These files are then read by `process_products.py` for transformation and loading to the database.
